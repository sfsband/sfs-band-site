          At <em>Small Steps Big Dreams</em>, we  are <strong>committed</strong> to offer each child the 
          <strong>unique opportunity</strong>
          of the hands-on learning of Montessori in a <strong>loving, Christian</strong>  environment.

              Dr. Maria Montessori began the first  Montessori children's house over a century ago in Rome.  
              In her observations of children and how they learn, she designed a "prepared  environment". 
              In this environment, children could freely choose from a number of developmentally appropriate activities.  
              The learning materials  are designed to help develop a sense of order,
              confidence, concentration, coordination, and independence, and are sequenced from simple to  complex.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Dr. Montessori discovered a three year age range in one classroom works best.  
              The older children help the younger  ones to learn, which in turn, 
              gives the older child confidence in their  knowledge, and inspires the younger child
                to learn what their classmate  knows.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              Each child is considered an individual,  where they are allowed to learn at their own pace. 
               The Montessori teacher  observes each child, which tells them when the child is ready 
               to be introduced  to a new skill or concept.
            </p>

              What makes Small Steps Big Dreams so special is that we bring Christianity into the Montessori classroom. 
               Each  day your child will be in a faith-based atmosphere.  As your child develops a relationship with God, 
               they will also be learning about the goodness of other children and be able to build a 
               positive relationship with others.  We feel the Montessori classroom combined with the Christian 
               atmosphere equals the  perfect learning environment!
